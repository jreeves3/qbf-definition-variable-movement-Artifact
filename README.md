# qbf-definition-variable-movement-Artifact

In the following days this repository will be populated with the definition variable movement toolchain.
This includes the CNF tools Kissat and cnftools for definition detection,
programs for variable movement and proof generation,
and QRAT-trim for proof verification.
In addition, several formulas from the QBFEVAL'20 benchmarks and solver binaries will be included for experimentation.
